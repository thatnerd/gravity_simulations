## Instructions for Claude
- Assume that the user is an experienced Python programmer
- Use Python 3 for all code unless instructed otherwise
- Put script files in the script/ directory
- Put all test files in the test/ directory
- Begin each file with a shebang
- Use docopt in every file for clarity, and a main() function
- Use type hints for every function
- Prioritize performance optimizations
- Use test-driven development wherever possible:
  - Begin with an architecture planning document
  - Write tests for functions and stub out functions initially, and confirm that the tests fail
  - After writing functions, run relevant tests and confirm they run correctly
  - Run the full test suite after any changes
